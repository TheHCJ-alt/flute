# Flute
a harpy fork made for Bluesky ðŸ¦‹

## Why create flute?
After @robertodoering announced that harpy would no longer be in active development following X's decision to disallow third-party X clients, I thought I would create a version of Harpy that uses Bluesky instead of X.

## What's working?
* Nothing :(
